It could range from how much rain a place usually gets, or a change in a placeâ€™s usual temperature.

    <footer>Atmosphere
	<p>
	The atmosphere is a thin layer of gases that surrounds Earth. Its main purpose is to seal the planet and protect us from the radiation given off by the Sun and small objects such as meteoroids. It also holds the oxygen we need to survive. There are layers in the atmosphere similar to inside of the Earth.The thickness of the atmosphere is a balance between the gravity of the Earth and energetic molecules that want to rise and move towards space. If the Earth happened to be larger, the atmosphere would be denser, or thicker.
