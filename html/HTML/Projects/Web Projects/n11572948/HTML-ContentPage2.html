	<br>The plan, created in 1905, was for Germany to go through Belgium to attack France, and loop back around to attack 
		Russia before the Russian milita was mobilized. Belgium was neutral, and had a treaty with Britain which ensured that
		if Belgium was attacked, British would come to their aid. When Germanys troops crossed into Belgium, the British and 
		Belgians responded. Russia's troops were already mobilized, both France and Russia were angered at Germany and WWI 
		effectively started.
