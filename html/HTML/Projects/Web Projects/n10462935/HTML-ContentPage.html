    States of Matter:
    <header>As we dive deeper you must first fully understand the four states of matter. Matter is another word 
	for the things that make up the world around us, anything that has mass and occupies space. In fact, everything in 
	the entire universe is made up of matter including the stars, planets, and so much more. The four states of matter are 
	Solids, liquids, gases, and plasma.

    <footer>Starting off with solids, they have a fixed shape meaning they can not change their form 
	unless there is a hard impact or force that acts upon it. This is due to the particles inside are stuck tightly with each other.
	Liquids are slightly different from solids. First off they can change their shape, take water for instance, it can flow freely and
	lose some of it's shape due to someone drinking the water. The particles here are close together, but they can still move around 
	each other. Gases are the complete opposite of solids. They are mostly invisible to human eyes, and are very simple to move through,
	this is because, the particles inside of gases are not connected to each other at all so they can easily float around without problems.
	Last but not least is Plasma, you can mainly find this state of matter on the sun and other stars. Plasmas are very energized gases, this
	is due to plasmas losing their electrons.
