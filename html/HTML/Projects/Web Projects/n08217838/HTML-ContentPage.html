	<article>
		<p align="left">OUR Solar System was formed about 4.6 billion years ago. When the universe was young it was constantly expanding at an alarming rate</p>
		<img src="images/expansion.jpg" alt="Image of the Solar System" align="left" style="width:500px;height:300px;">
		<p align="left">During it's rapid expansion, gas gathered around in giant balls generating stars and gas planets. 
		And large forms of asteroids, comets, rocks, debris formed Terrestrial Planets.</p>
		<p align="left">Our Solar System located in the Milky Way Galaxy is composed of a central star know as the Sun.
		As well as 8 planets in order from closest for furthest;</p>

		<article>
		<p align="left">Terrestrial planets also known as the "Inner Planets", are the four innermost planets of our solar system. These planets(Mercury, Venus, Earth
             and Mars) are composed of silicate rocks and metals.</p>
		<img src="images/Terrestrial.jpg" alt="Rocket-ship logo" align="center" style="width:400px;height:175px;">
		<p align="left">A sure-tell way of telling apart a gas and a terrestrial planet is the nature of the surface. Terrestrial
              planets surface's are solid and hard. Gas planets are surrounded with a thick atmosphere and can barely see the surface.</p>
		<img src="images/Gasgiants.jpg" alt="Rocket-ship logo" align="left" style="width:350px;height:225px;">
		<p align="left">Gas Giants (Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune) are characterized by their name. They are many times larger than Terrestrial planets, and hold lots of gas within their
		atmosphere.</p>
		<p align="left">They are located further away from the Sun than their Terrestrial counterparts. So temperature are lot more cooler. And the time it 
		takes to orbit the sun is greater. Composed of mostly gas and do contain small amounts of rocky material at the core </p>

		<p align="left"> The Milky Way Galaxy is our home galaxy. A galaxy is a system of millions or billions of stars, gas and dust, held together
		by gravity. Many Solar Systems can be found within a Galaxy. A simplified order goes like this:</p>
