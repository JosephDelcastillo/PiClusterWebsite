    Celestial Bodies in the Universe:
	<header>This page lists below a variety of different things/objects found in space.</header>
    <article>
		Planets:<hr>
			<u>Terrestrial planets</u> are composed primarily of various types of rocks and minerals, as well as metals. In the Solar System, the rocky planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars.</br>
			<u>Gas giants</u> are massive planets composed primarily of helium and hydrogen gas. In the Solar System, the gas giants are: Jupiter, and Saturn.</br>
			<u>Ice giants</u> are planets that are massive like gas giants, but made of different materials; they are made of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur. In the Solar System, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants.</br>
			<u>Dwarf planets</u> are basically planet-size masses that orbit a star, are larger than a moon, but are smaller than a normal-size planet. Pluto was no longer considered a planet due to the discovery of a large number of similar planets, as a result the class of “dwarf planet” was made.</br></br>
		Larger Stuff:<hr>
			<u>Stars</u> are bodies made of plasma, essentially burning gases, and held together by its own gravity. At night, many stars can be seen because of the light they emit, the Sun being the largest as it is the closest to us.</br></br>

			<u>Nebulae</u> are cloud of gas and dust in space, these can sometimes be seen in the night sky as a bright patch.</br>
			<u>Galaxies</u> come in various shapes and sizes and are groups of planets, stars, and other celestial bodies. The galaxy we live in, the Milky Way, is a spiral galaxy. Other types include elliptical and irregular galaxies.</br></br>
		Weird Stuff:<hr>
			<u>Black holes</u> are areas in space where the gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light can escape it. As a result of light not leaving a black hole, they are not visible to people. Black holes are believed to form from a collapsing star, although such a star would need to be much larger than the Sun.</br>
			<u>White holes</u> are areas in space which cannot be entered from the outside, but it ejects large amounts of light and matter. A white hole is essentially the opposite of a black hole, although there is proof of the existence of black holes, there is not yet any of white holes.</br>
			<u>Voids</u> simply are large areas of space where little-to-no object, stars, or anything exist. They are only visible due to the absolute lack of light or anything in them, making them spots of large spots of darkness.

			<li>Get a bachelor's degree in engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics (with some exceptions).</li></br>
			<li>Apply directly to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).</li></br>
			<li>Train continuously for what you will experience and do in space, such as zero-gravity.</li>
