        Some people spend hours at a time on their computers doing either really important stuff or making cat videos (which is equally as important really) and yet some of them still
        have really bland desktops and the only excuse people have brought up to defend this is "functionality over form" which is rather stupid to me because I believe functionality
        can come with form and deliver the same if not better results. To prove this I've made a whole website dedicated to showing you how you can customize your expirence on your
        desktop to make it more plesent for you to look at. Not only that, but through desktop customization you can make your whole computer and setup around you as a whole flow better 
        as well as change the whole tone of the desktop, for example:
        <br>
        <br>
        You can feel and see the difference between this:
        <br> 
        <br>
        <img src="photos/stockDesktop.png" width="1000" height="500">
        <br>
        <br>
        And This:
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="photos/desktopExample.png" width="1000" height="500">
        <br>
        <br>
        Thing is, You don't even have to stop there, what I'm going to be showing you here is just a small amount compared to just what you could change and customize, I'm goinig to be
        showing you how to install and use rainmeter which can do wonders on its own when paired with the right background but the possibilities are almost endless, you could change small
        things like your mouse pointer to things like the sounds your computer makes and just how the icons look, some of those things taking little to almost no skill but because there
        would be alot to say in words i'll make it a little faster and easier on you and provide video links on how to do all of the other things I mentioned.

        Not just that but there is also a seperate page on some shortcuts and tips I find useful and feel like more people should know about and use more often, so if you want head on over
        there and check it out.
