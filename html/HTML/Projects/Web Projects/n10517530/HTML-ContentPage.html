	<u>The Solar System</u>
    <article>The solar system is made up the planets that orbit around the sun in a predictable path. The Sun is orbited by Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. The paths that planets and moons follow is caused by gravitational force between the Sun and the planets.</br>

	<u>Orbits</u>
	<article>The orbits of Earth around the sun and of the moon around Earth, together with the rotation of Earth about an axis between its North and South poles, cause visible patterns. These patterns include day and night; daily changes in the length and direction of shadows; and different positions of the sun, moon, and stars at different times of the day, month, and year.</article>
	<u>The Sun</u>
    <footer>The Sun isn’t the largest, brightest or hottest star visible from Earth, it only appears this way due to how close it is. The Sun's radius is 432,169 mi. The largest star visible from Earth is VY Canis Majoris, which has a radius of 987.9 million km. The temperature of the sun is 5,778° Kelvin(approximately 9941° Fahrenheit). The hottest star visible from Earth is Sirius, which has a temperature of 18,000° F.</br>
