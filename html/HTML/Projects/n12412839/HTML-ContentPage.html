	<article>There are currently two ways that scientists think that the earth was formed. One way is the <strong>Core Accretion Theory</strong> where
		gravity collapses the dust and bits in space into massive orbs or land called planets. The second theory is the <strong>Disk Instability Model</strong>
		where there are already clumps of dust in space but over time, they collide and slowly grow into planets. Even though scientists are not
		exactly sure how the Earth was formed, they do know for certain that life eventually builds on the surface and plants and animals appear!</article>

	<article>There are four scientific elements that make up 90% of our Earth. These elements can be found on a table of all of the other elements that
		scientists found called the periodic table. The elements that make up most of earth are Iron, Oxygen. Silicon, and Magnesium. Iron and Silicon,
		are very useful for creating lots of machines and toys we use every day. Oxygen helps us breathe, and Magnesium can be found in food and 
		medicines that we eat and drink.</article>
