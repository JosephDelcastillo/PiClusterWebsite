	<h3>Amphibians</h3>
	<p>Amphibians earned their name because they live their first half of life in water and their final half on land.when they first hatch, amphibians are born with gills in order for them to swim and breathe water like fish do. Amphibians are cold blooded and transform from their larvae stage as time goes on. FUN FACT: getting warts from touching a frog or toad is a MYTH!</p>

	<h3>Fish</h3>
	<p>Fish are vertebrates. That means they have a backbone. But unlike mammals, fish donâ€™t have lungs. They breathe by taking oxygen from the water in through their mouths, where it passes over the gills. The gills then absorb oxygen from the water and send the oxygen throughout the body. Some fish are carnivores. They eat other fish and small animals and insects. </p>
