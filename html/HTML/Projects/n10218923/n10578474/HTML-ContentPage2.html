    What happened during the Italian Unification?
    <article align="left">
	<h3 align="center"> Revolutions of 1848 </h3>
		<p>
		<strong>Causes:</strong>
		<ol align="left">
			<li>poor harvests=food shortages</li>
			<li>the government had a small amount of money</li>
			<li>businesses failed</li>
			<li>small pay=bad living conditions</li>
			<li>small amount of jobs</li>
			<li> middle class was dominant with uncontrolled economies</li>
			<li> nationalism</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong> What Happened? </strong>
		<br> Riots occured in Sicily, Naples, Milan, Venice, Piedmont, 
		and Rome, but failed because the riots were random and 
		lost enthusiasm, landowners easily took control of 
		movements, the middle class started to fear radicalism,
		and divisions of national groups in Eastern Europe. 
		</p>
		<p> 
		<strong>What Was Learned?</strong>
		<br>L - Leadership:push for unification needs to be accepted 
		<br>U - Unity: cooperation between all Italian states
		<br>C - Common Aim: compromise is need 
		<br>I - Internation: revolution needs help from other countries
		<br>A - Austria: Austrian control must be defeated

	<p>
	<p>
	<strong> April 1859</strong>- The Second Italian War starts when Austria
