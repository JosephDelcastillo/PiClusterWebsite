    Facts
    <header>The first known robot was made in the 5th century BC by Archytas of Tarentum (Philosopher) which was a long time ago. He made mechanical doves driven by a jet of steam which isn't a big deal but is still the first robot ever made.<img src="images/archytas.jpg" alt="Robot" height="150" width="150"></header> 
    <article> “Robot” comes from the Czech word robota, meaning“drudgery,” and first appeared in the 1921 play R.U.R. (Rossum’s Universal Robots). So people did not come up with the name until almost 100 years ago. But people were making robots before that.<br> <img src="images/rur.jpg" alt="Robot" height="200" width="200"></header>  </article>
