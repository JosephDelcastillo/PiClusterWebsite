    <header>Adding and Subtracting Fractions and Decimals:
	<ul>
	   <li>While adding and subtracting decimals you must always make sure to have the same denominator on both fractions or else you are not able to add or subtract. 
		<li>While adding decimals always make sure to add up or subtract the correct number place. You may also look for the larger value and subtract the lower one to help you conduct the problem.

	<article>Multiplying and Dividing Fractions and Decimals:
	<ul>
		<li>Common denominators are not needed, but can and should be used. <br>
		<li>Always change mixed numbers to improper fractions. <br>
		<li>Multiplying:Numerator times numerator, denominator times denominator. Always reduce answer to a mixed number as simplified as possible.
		<li>Division:The most effective way is to take the division sign and change it into a multiplication sign. Then proceed to keep the first term and flip the second term.

    <footer>Geometry and Algebraic Thinking:
	<ul>
		<li>Always use the order of operations when thinking algebraically.(PEMDAS)
		<li>Use a pair of perpendicular number lines, called axes, to define a coordinate system, with the intersection of the lines (the origin) arranged to coincide with the 0 on each line and a given point in the plane located by using an ordered pair of numbers, called its coordinates. Understand that the first number indicates how far to travel from the origin in the direction of one axis, and the second number indicates how far to travel in the direction of the second axis.
