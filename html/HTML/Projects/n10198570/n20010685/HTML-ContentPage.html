    Information on Eclipses
    <header>A solar eclipse happens when the New Moon moves between Earth and the Sun.There are between 2 and 5 solar eclipses every year.
	 A total solar eclipse occurs when the Moon completely covers the Sun, as seen from Earth.The only way to safely watch a solar eclipse is to wear protective eclipse glasses.</header>
    <article>A lunar eclipse occurs when Earth casts a shadow on the Full Moon.In a lunar eclipse the Moon does not have its own light.It shines because
	its surface reflects the Sun's rays. There are 3 kinds of lunar eclipses:total, partial, and penumbral.These occur when the Sun, Earth, and the
	Moon align in a straight or almost straight configuration.</article>
    <footer>If a planet comes between Earth and the Sun, and is visible as a black dot against the Sun, it's called a Planet Transit.
	The only 2 planets that can be seen transiting the Sun from Earth are Venus and Mercury because they're the only planets which orbit inside Earth's orbit.</footer>
