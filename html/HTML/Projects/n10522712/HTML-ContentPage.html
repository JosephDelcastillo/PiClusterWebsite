	Cyclones
    <footer>A cyclone is an area of closed, circular fluid motion.
	<p>It has low pressure on the inside and high pressure on the outside.<p>
    <p>The center of the storm is called the eye and it has the calmest water and the lowest pressure.<p>
    <p>Cyclones turn counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. This is because it follows the rotational movement of the earth.<p>
	<p>The biggest cyclone recorded in the Bhola cyclone. It hit the coast of today’s Bangladesh in 1970 with a death toll of around 500,000.<p>

	Earthquakes
	<footer>is the result of a sudden release of energy from the earth’s crust that creates seismic waves. 
	<p>They are measured using seismographs.<p>
    <p>The Valdivia earthquake also known as the great Chilean earthquake is the biggest earthquake ever recorded.<p>

	Tornado   
	<footer><p> Tornado conditions are caused when different temperatures and humidity meet to form thunder clouds. </p>
			<p> Also nicknamed “Twisters” can attain speeds up to 100 miles an hour</p>
			<p> The biggest tornado recorded was the Hallam, Nebraska tornado on May 22, 2004. It was around 2.5 miles big and had a death toll of around 160. </p>

	Volcanoes 
	<footer><p>Volcanic Eruption A volcano is an opening in a planet’s surface which allows hot magma to escape from below the surface. </p>
	<p>Study of volcanos is called Volcanology and volcanic eruptions are measured using Volcanic Exclusivity Index</p>
	<p>The biggest volcanic eruption was Mount Tambura on April 10, 1815, it heard over 2000 km away and had a death toll of around 71,000.</p>

EXTRA FUN HOME ACTIVITY! 
	<footer>Follow these directions to succesfully simulate a Tornado
	What you'll need: Water, Plastic Bottle, Glitter, Dish wishing liquid 
	<p>1. Fill a plastic bottle with water untill it is 3 quaters full</p> 
	<p>2. Add a few drops of dish washing liquid</p>
	<p>3. Add some glitter so it it easier to actually see the torando in motion</p>
	<p>4. Tightly put the cap on the bottle so no water spills</p>
	<p>5. Turn the water bottle upside down and spin it in a circular motion and finally have fun! </p>
