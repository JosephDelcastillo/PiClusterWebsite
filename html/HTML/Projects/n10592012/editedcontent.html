    <h2>Customization</h2>
	
	<p>
        
	<strong>
	Customization can turn your desktop from bland and boring to something awesome and unique. It allows you to put your own personal touch on your computer desktop that normally is hard to get, but with simple programs you can customize your desktop to look like whatever you want.
    </strong>

	You're gonna need to install a little program called <a href="https://www.rainmeter.net/" target="_blank">Rainmeter</a>. It is important you download the beta as that will allow 
	the most compatibility which is something that you will appriciate in the long run. Once you get to the website, click the "Download Beta" button and the download will begin. Once it is downloaded
	run the installer and follow the instructions on screen until rainmeter is installed.

	Woah woah woah, hold on just a minute there pal, before you start decking out yourself with skin galore you're gonna need a decent 
	background to do that on so go find yourself something nice, personaly I recommend <a href="http://wallpaperswide.com/" target="_blank"> WallpaperWide.com</a>
	because they have just about every resolution you could possibly need and also offer a wide range of catagories and wallpapers, but thats just my recommendation and 
	you of course are free to make your own choice.

    Found a background you like? Now hop back onto <a href="https://rainmeter.deviantart.com/gallery/23941137/skins" target="_blank">This Site</a> and find some nice rainmeter skins you like, 
	remember the choices here are practically endless. If you look at the left colum you can see a few catagories of items you can add which can also add function with looks to your desktop.
    </p>
	
	<p>
	Now I'm not going to go over ever single thing you should or need to do because it is rather self-explanatory but what I will do is provide some examples
	for you to get encouragement from because I find that helps the most when it comes to making your desktop your own. Plus, under the video tab I'll make sure to add some tutorials or videos that will help you if you need a more in-depth explanation or if you're more of a visual learner.
