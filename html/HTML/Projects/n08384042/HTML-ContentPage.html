    <header>Physical vs. Chemical Changes
	<li>A physical change doesn't change what the substance is</li>
	<li>A chemical change causes a chemical reaction, a new substance is formed</li>
	<li>Example: if a piece of paper is cut up into small pieces it's still paper.  This would be a physical change in the shape and size of the paper.</li>
	<li>Example: if the paper is burned, it is broken up into different substances that are not paper.</li></header>

    <footer>The Three Types of Rock Formation
	<li>Sedimentary rocks are formed through the gradual accumulation of sediments, for example, sand on a beach or mud on a river bed</li>
	<li>Igneous rocks are rocks which have crystallized from a melt or magma. As it cools and various rock types will form through a process known as fractional crystallization.</li>
	<li>Metamorphic rocks are rocks which once existed as igneous or sedimentary rocks but have been subjected to varying degrees of pressure and heat of the Earth's crust.</li></footer>
