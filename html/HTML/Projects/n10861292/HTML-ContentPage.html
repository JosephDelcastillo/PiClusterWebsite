    Here's the Facts
    <header>Dinosaurs are about 225 million years old. They lived in what is called the late Mesozoic Era. There are three different time periods in the 
	mesozoic era: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.There are many dinosaurs that lived during this time, but no humans.<br>

    <article>There are many different dinosaurs. Some may be familiar but most you may not have heard of. You might know the famous Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex for short.
	This specific dinosaur was a carnivore. This means they only eat meat. Paleontologist know this by the way their teeth were shaped. There are also other carnivores such as the Ceratosaurus or Spinosaurus<br>

	Another type of dinosaur are herbivores. These dinosaurs only eat plants. One of the most renowned herbivore is the Triceratops.
	It is easily recognized by the three horns on top of its head. Other herbivores include the Brachiosaurus and Ankylosaurus.<br>

    <footer>Now the exciting part! The dinosaurs were believed to have lived on a single land mass called Pangaea millions of years ago.
	As you already know, the dinosaurs are no longer around and the continents are separated. You're probably thinking about what happened.
	One theory suggest that a large asteroid penetrated the Earth's atmosphere and made impact on the surface of Pangaea.
	The impact of the asteroid wasn't powerful enough to destroy Earth but caused a mass extinction event for the dinosaurs.<br>
